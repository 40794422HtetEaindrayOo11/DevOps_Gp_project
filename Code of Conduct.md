# Team Values and Responsibilities

Our team is committed to upholding the Scrum values of **Focus, Respect, Openness, Courage, and Commitment** throughout the project lifecycle.

## Scrum Values

### Focus
Each member dedicates attention to sprint goals and avoids distractions to ensure that assigned reports and development tasks are completed on time.

### Respect
We recognize and value each member’s role and contributions, including the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers. Respectful communication will be maintained at all times, regardless of differing opinions.

### Openness
Team members will share progress, blockers, and suggestions openly during meetings or through the agreed communication tool. Transparency ensures the team can respond quickly to challenges.

### Courage
Members are encouraged to take initiative, suggest improvements, and address issues confidently, whether related to technical difficulties, workflow problems, or team dynamics.

### Commitment
Every member is expected to complete assigned deliverables within the sprint, contribute fairly to the workload, and take full ownership of their responsibilities.

### Academic Integrity
All contributions must be original. Members must avoid plagiarism and ensure all work (code, documentation, diagrams) is their own or properly cited.
